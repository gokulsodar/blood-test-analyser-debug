I started by creating a venv using uv inside the dir but I noticed dependency conflict when I tried installing the libs 
so I when I checked req.txt it was written that crewai version must not be changed so I decided I'll install that alone and commend the rest out
after installing that I also installed other lib I though wud be needed based on wat i noticed in the code
then I went through the code and made changes like all the tasks had doctor as its agent so I changed that to its respective agents
then i ran main.py I ran into an error I realised that was bcos 
while running the Passing the app instance directly caused an error (possibly related to reload).
Using the string import path allows Uvicorn to reload the app correctly during development.
then I ran into an error where the bloddtestreport tool wasn't being used properly 
Refactored the PDF reading functionality for blood test reports by replacing the standalone async read_data_tool method with a new BloodTestReportTool class that inherits from BaseTool (from crewai.tools). The new implementation uses pypdf.PdfReader for PDF extraction and is structured to integrate with the CrewAI tool system.
Reason:
To standardize tool creation and enable integration with the CrewAI framework by inheriting from BaseTool.
I edited the other tools to comply with the same crewai format 
then i set up the api keys in .env file and setup the serperdevtool as well
